# theme-bluloco-dark

## Description

A fancy but yet sophisticated dark designer color scheme / theme for
Visual Studio Code.

Originally forked from the beautiful One Dark Theme, enhanced with the
meaningful intuitive bluloco color palette.

This theme features a much more comprehensive usage of syntax scopes and color
consistency, with due regards to aesthetics, contrast and readability.

This theme also works very good when Apple's **Nightshift Mode** is activated.

Give it a try :)

## Screenshots
